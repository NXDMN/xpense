# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Welcome to **Xpense**! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Xpense
handles your data and ensures that your personal information remains secure.

## Data Collection and Storage

- All expense-related data, including categories, amounts, notes, and photos, are stored **locally
  on your device**.
- The app does not require an internet connection and functions **entirely offline**.

## Data Usage

Since all data is stored locally, you have complete control over your expenses. You can edit or
delete any record at any time. Xpense does not track or analyze your data in any way.

## Permissions Requested

Xpense requires certain permissions to function properly. These permissions are used **only** for
their intended purpose and do not result in data being collected or shared.

- **Read External Storage (`android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`)**
    - Required on devices running **Android 12L (API level 32) or lower**.
    - Used to allow users to select and upload photos for their expense records.

- **Read Media Images (`android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`)**
    - Required on devices running **Android 13 (API level 33) or higher**.
    - Used to access images selected by the user through the **system photo picker**.

    - Used to handle media selection within the app when users pick images via the **system photo
      picker**.

ðŸ“Œ **Xpense does not browse or modify any files outside of the images explicitly selected by the
user.** The app does not support video uploads and does not request access to video files.

## Third-Party Services

Xpense does **not** use third-party analytics, ads, or cloud storage. No information is shared with
external parties.

## User Rights and Control

- You can add, edit, or delete your expenses and categories at any time.
- If you uninstall the app, all stored data will be **permanently deleted** as it is only saved on
  your device.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated in the future if the app introduces new features that affect data
storage or security. Any changes will be reflected in future versions of the app.
