# Xpense

This project is built using Android Jetpack Compose with Kotlin, following the Android recommended
architecture for a
modern and scalable app structure. The app uses Room Database, a local storage solution, to
efficiently manage and persist expense data. This project was developed as a hands-on learning
experience to explore Jetpack Compose and implement best practices in Android development.

Xpense is a simple and efficient expense management app that helps users track their spending with
ease. Users can log expenses by selecting a date, entering the amount spent, choosing or creating a
category with a custom icon and color, adding notes, and uploading photos for better record-keeping.
The app allows full control over expenses with the ability to edit and delete entries. A pie chart
visualization provides insights into spending habits, allowing users to filter data by date, month,
or year and sort expenses by category or date. Additionally, users can set a favorite category,
which will be preselected when adding a new expense. Xpense is completely free, works offline, and
does not display ads. All data is securely stored on the userâ€™s device without being shared or
stored elsewhere.
